# AI - Object Detection - Continuous Delivery 
Continuous delivery pipeline for object detection models and apps

### Instructions

This is a ML continuos delivery pipeline based on GitHub Actions. Please

It can be used to train a RCNN model with custom images then obtain a new model that can be evaluated using **MLFlow**
